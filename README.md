# Measurement Trivia Game

### About this Project

Test your knowledge of both the metric and imperial units of measurement. Each question is timed and will move onto the next if left unanswered. After each question, a fun GIF is briefly displayed according to whether or not you were correct. At the end of the game, the number of right, wrong, and unanswered responses is displayed along side your overall score. Your high scores are also shown at the bottom of the results page.
